# An Empirical Analysis of the Docker Container Ecosystem on GitHub - Online Appendix

This is the online appendix of the paper "An Empirical Analysis of the Docker Container Ecosystem on GitHub" published at MSR'17.
It contains the scripts we used to analyze the dataset and to create the plots presented in the paper.

**NOTE:** We updated the underlying dataset (February 2018) and made it available separately. 
The dataset is described in the paper _"Structured Information on State and Evolution of Dockerfiles"_ accepted at the Data Showcase Track of MSR'18.
More details on the dataset, the tooling we used to collect, and a link to download can be found [here](https://github.com/sealuzh/msr18-docker-dataset).
